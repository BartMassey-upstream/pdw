Produce, Defend, WIN!

There's a lot I could say, the big thing on my mind at the moment,
I learned game programming in Python this last month by reading
Hello World! Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners
by Warren D. Sande and Carter Sande. Highly recommended, we got
the book for Steven but I had fun working through it myself and
this seemed a fun way to add Python to my resume.

Developed on OS X and I've ran it on Windows and saw it run on 
Linux... only requires a working Pygame environment 
http://www.pygame.org and no other libraries or anything special.

I hope you enjoy the game!  See COPYING for license terms.
